# Gulp - Bootstrap - JQuery Boilerplate

A basic boilerplate that I use across a few projects that other people may find useful in their own.

## Installation

1. Download or clone the repo, navigate to the directory using terminal and run npm install
2. Type gulp in the terminal in the same directory
3. Browsersync will launch on port 3000.


Don't copy the contents of the folder into another or you will loose the .jshintrc file which is required to run gulp.

Currently this is setup to work with sass, rather than scss, but you can change that in the gulpfile.js

Place any html / php files in the app directory, raw js and sass files belong in the src directory.  Libs all belong in the app directory
